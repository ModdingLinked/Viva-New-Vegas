            Introduction
                <p>Welcome to Viva New Vegas, a fully modular vanilla-plus modding guide for Fallout New Vegas!</p>
        </h2>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            IMPORTANT: Everything in this guide is written down for a reason! It is vital to read <b>everything!</b>
            You can NOT skip any paragraphs/instructions and expect your game to function as it should.

            <p class="subparagraph">
                    Viva New Vegas is a modding guide for Fallout New Vegas that will carefully walk you through how to install all the mods you will need for a perfectly stable, smooth, and most importantly, enjoyable experience.
                    Unlike other modding guides, it is built with customization in mind. Mods are subjective, so every mod listed in the guide is 100% optional.
                    Custom patches and a hand-made load order and will be provided for the guide, and they will still work if you skipped any mods.
                    <br> <br>
                    The guide is highly accessible for everyone, no matter your modding experience.
                    It still is incredibly important that you read <u>all</u> the instructions very carefully, even if you believe you are experienced enough to skip them.
                    There are many small instructions that are vital for your game to function, and could be easily missed if you aren't careful. Although you don't need any modding experience to use this guide,
                    it is expected for you to be relatively experienced with operating a computer in general.
            </p>

                <ul class="standard_ul">
                    <li>
                        <b>Stability:</b>
                            Don't let crashing be a core feature of the game anymore! The guide includes all essential stability enhancements and no placebo/dangerous mods.
                            With a complete install of the guide, you should have zero crashes! Of course there are no guarantees with New Vegas though.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Performance:</b>
                            Every tool, setting, and mod in the guide has been carefully selected and play-tested to ensure maximum possible performance.
                            No 4k texture mods, no ENBs, no poorly scripted mods, or any other un-optimized/broken mods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Better Gameplay:</b>
                            The guide includes many mods that greatly improve the gameplay, without drastically overhauling the core experience or straying away from the game's original intent. This section is highlighted by <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62153" target="_blank">Real Recoil</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66666" target="_blank">Just Assorted Mods</a>.
                            There is also an optional <b>Overhauls</b> section that will make the game much more difficult and add some new vanilla-friendly content. This section is highlighted by <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61592" target="_blank">JSawyer Ultimate Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64623" target="_blank">The Living Desert</a>. This section is not recommended for first time players.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Custom Mods and Patches:</b>
                            When needed, the guide will provide custom mods, addendums to existing mods, or patches for mods to make them compatible and consistent with the guide.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Customizability:</b>
                            The guide is fully modular, every mod listed is 100% optional. Hand-made load order and patches will be provided, and they will work perfectly even if you left out any mods.
                            For information regarding adding your own mods, see the <a href="./intro.html#additional_mods">Additional Mods</a> section below.

                <ul class="standard_ul">
                    <li>An English copy of the game with all DLCs from either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/sub/13435" target="_blank">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/fallout_new_vegas_ultimate_edition" target="_blank">GOG</a> (instructions for properly installing it are in the next step)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Only the English version of the game is supported for maximum compatibility. The Bethesda.net and Xbox Gamepass versions of the game are also unsupported, as they do not work with xNVSE which is essential for most mods.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>At least 12GB of free drive space</li>
                    <li>Windows 7 or higher (64bit)</li>

                    <li>A text editor (I recommend <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>, but the default Windows notepad will work)</li>
                    <li>An archiving tool (I recommend <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a>)</li>

                <p class="subparagraph">
                    If you are looking to add more mods to your setup, please wait until <b>after</b> you have completed the guide, or else we will be unable to help you on <a href="https://discord.gg/DhX5S27" target="_blank">Discord</a> should you need it.
                    Unfortunately, I do not have the time or energy to provide support for setups that install extra mods on top of the guide.
                    If you do plan on adding mods after you finish the guide, please reference <a href="./avoid-mods.html" target="_blank">this</a> list of mods that you should avoid using.
                    I can not stress enough that it is only recommended to add your own mods if you are an experienced modder and know how to manually
                    make conflict resolution patches and sort your load order! You can't just throw a bunch of mods on top of the guide without doing any conflict resolution
                    or use automated tools and except your game to function as intended! A reminder that I will <u>not</u> support setups that have added any mods.

            <a class="internallink" href="#recommended_specs"><h2 class="subheader" id="recommended_specs">Recommended Specs:</h2></a>
                <p class="subparagraph">
                    The guide will make the game run much better than vanilla. As the game is ten years old, you do not need a very strong PC to run it.
                    Installing the game on an SSD can drastically improve load times and decrease stuttering.
                    Here are the recommended specs for being able to run the guide at 60FPS in 1080p:
                    <br> <br>
                        <ul class="standard_ul">
                            <li><b>CPU:</b> Any dual-core processor (2.5GHz or more)</li>
                            <li><b>RAM:</b> 4GB of RAM (speed shouldn't affect performance much)</li>
                            <li><b>GPU:</b> NVIDIA 600 series card or an AMD 5500 series card</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
