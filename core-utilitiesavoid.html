        <p class="moddesc"><strong>NVSR:</strong> You may be wondering why NVSR isn't in the guide. NVSR has many broken settings, that when turned off essentially
            disable the features that remove the stuttering, making it pointless. There are also bugs with NVSR unrelated to settings, such as the
            really long fingers and bouncing NPCs. That being said, the following settings are broken in NVSR:</p>
                <ul class="specialinstructions">
                    <li><strong>bManageFPS:</strong> Doesn't straight up limit FPS, but maintains a minimum FPS, so it starts to disable LOD and other things to maintain that FPS (paraphrased from RoyBatty)</li>
                    <li><strong>bHookLightCriticalSections (Only fully broken on Windows 10):</strong> Bad implementation, broken by Windows 10 because the author relied on undefined behavior instead of <br>
                        following the API. Causes crashes every 15-ish minutes
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>bReplaceHeap:</strong> Outdated implementation, extremely unstable, not large adress aware. Performs in function by increasing FPS, but at the cost of a much higher crash rate</li>
                </ul>
        <p class="moddesc"><strong>ENBoost:</strong> NVR/NVGE has superior memory management as requires no tweaking, unlike ENBoost which needs a lot of system-specific tweaking to make your game not run worse</p>
        <p class="moddesc"><strong>Zan AutoPurge Crash Protector:</strong> Unsafe/unstable, same function is performed safely by the .INI tweaks in the guide</p>
        <p class="moddesc"><strong>PCB Hotkey:</strong> Unsafe</p>
        <p class="moddesc"><strong>Save Cleaner:</strong> No, just no</p>
        <p class="moddesc"><strong>Performance of the Gods (or pretty much all mods with "Performance" in the title):</strong> Performance gain is placebo, disabling random clutter items with less than 5 polygons isn't going to do anything</p>
