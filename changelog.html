            <p class="moddesc">
                - Removed Unnecessary Tweaks from Core - Optional Bug Fixes/QOL (taken down by author, no need to remove it from your setup if you already have it installed)
            </p>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>02/21/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                Just a few things I forgot to add to the update a few days ago: <br>
                - Added Faster Pip-Boy to Optional Bug Fixes <br>
                - Added instructions to remove the One in a Million trait
            </p> 
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>02/18/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                This may seem like a big update by looking at the size of the changelog, but most of it is format and update stuff rather than actually contents of the guide being added/removed <br> <br>
                Starting with the actual additions/removals: <br>
                - Removed NVGE/NVR from Core - Utilities, along with all the preset INI (way too many bugs and potential performance loss to warrant keeping around for what little upside it may have. May be re-introduced if the big update thats on the way fixes the problems) <br>
                - Removed RTSS from Core - Tools (can sometimes cause issues with MO2's VFS and an FPS cap really isn't needed anymore with NVTF) <br>
                - Added Occulsion Overhaul to Core - Bug Fixes <br>
                - Switched from CASM back to the ESPless save system in Stewie's Tweaks (the save game bug with Stewie's Tweaks has since been identified and fixed) <br>
                - Exchanged Loot Menu for Just Loot Menu in Core - HUD/UI <br>
                - Switched DarnUI to the updated TTW version (now has an oHUD patch so it is a straight improvement from the old version) <br>
                - Removed all the optional DarnUI stuff (included in the TTW version) <br> 
                - Removed ILO (interior tweaks included in my new tweaked RWL plugin)<br>
                - Exchanged Fellout for my tweaked version of RWL (yes i know switching weather mods is a meme at this point, the gods just dont want it to be i guess) <br>
                - Added a note to the lStewieAl's Tweaks part in Gameplay - Mechanics about enabling the new <strong>bBarterCheckActorBuySellFlags</strong> feature, along with a custom mod meant to compliment it<br>
                - Replaced Rewarding Exploring with GRA Relocated (better placement and balance, Gameplay Conflict Resolution was also updated to reflect this change) <br>
                - Added NPCs Sprint to Gameplay - Mechanics and to the Gameplay - Merge <br> 
                - Added Dead Money Stealth Fix, Better Archimedes II, and some of Mastahbossu's Misc Mods to Yukichigai Gameplay Tweaks <br>
                - Added Recharger Rifle Rebalance with Scope Mod and Dead Money Toxic Cloud fix to Gameplay - Optional Mechanics <br>
                - Removed Future Fallout Chems and Fallout 76 Mutations (wasn't happy with the overall balance of them, updated Content - Conflict Resolution to reflect this) <br><br>
                And now for the format changes: <br>
                - Made "optional" sections after each Core step that contain smaller, easily mergeable mods that don't require conflict resolution <br>
                - Merged the Bug Fix and QOL steps (with moving some mods to optional, the step became too small to keep on its own) <br>
                - Changed the installation of all the Utilities to manual rather than normally through MO2 <br>
                - Added instructions to install the releasefast version of NVSE (issues with it and JIP LN are now fixed) <br>
                - Changed OneTweak link to the more recently updated Skyrim page
                - All guide emporium files are now hosted on Github rather than Nexus (fuck you Nexus) <br>
                - Updated lStewieAl's Tweaks INI <br>
                - Moved Melee Reach Fixed, Sierra Madre Exterior Fixed, Enslaving Arcade Fix, Female White Glove Society Mask, Motion Sickness Destroyer, Unnecessary Tweaks, and Wear Glasses with Masks to the Optional Bug Fixes/QOL Improvements <br>
                - Added Lucky 38 World LOD Fix and Psycho and Slasher Bonus Damage Fix to the optional Bug Fixes/QOL Improvements <br>
                - Moved Quickthrow, Retrievable Throwables, Just Mods Assorted, and JIP CCC to Gameplay - Mechanics <br>
                - Moved MCM Matches HUD Color, Caravan Card Control, MTUI Dialogue Background, and No Traps Popup to Optional HUD/UI <br>
                - Moved Bypass Minigames, Well Rested Overhaul, Better NCR Supply Cache, Honest Hearts Workbench Crate Luck and Take Chems Make Fiends to Mechanics - Optional <br>
                - Updated Vault 22 Flora Overhaul ESP Replacer (removed even more junk from it, all the out of place stuff should now be gone) <br>
                - Updated all Conflict Resolutions and Load Orders where necessary
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>02/02/20</strong></p>

        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>02/01/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Changed some wording throughout the frontpage and Core module <br>
                - Requirements moved from Core to frontpage <br>
                - Fixed FNVLodGen link (the official version is untested) <br>
                - A NexusMods account is now required <br>
                - Added an optional tweak to New Vegas Tick Fix <br>

        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>01/04/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Exchanged Nevada Skies for Fellout (the updated version of Nevada Skies got taken down, so it need to be switched in the guide. If you grabbed Nevada Skies before it went down, you can continue using it)
            </p>
        <br>

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added instructions for hiding EXE sun glare texture (stacks with NS which creates that ugly large sunglare) <br>
                - Removed Quest Item Hider from Core - HUD/UI (made redundant by the newest version of lStewieAl's Tweaks) <br>
                - Removed Pickpocket Overhaul from Gameplay - Mechanics (made redundant by the newest version of lStewieAl's Tweaks) <br>

            <p class="moddesc">
                Guys I fucked up and kinda did a big update again my b (this will all work on an existing save but also remember you don't need to do any of this. also i accidentally deleted this changelog the first time i made it so if i missed a thing or two oops come and yell at me on Discord) <br>
                - Exchanged UPP for UPNVSE (potentially controversial change, but is long overdue imo) <br>
                - Removed Reactivated Hit Topics and Rebreather Fixed from Core - Bug Fixes (redundant with UPNVSE) <br>
                - Removed Asterra's Many Fixes (there have been a lot of problematic meshes with that mod, and bad meshes are the #1 cause of crashes) <br>
                - Removed Enhanced Camera (semi-badly made mod overall, causes clipping in first person with some armors, especially custom ones which makes them completely unwearable. Also small conflict with Just Vanilla Sprint that can't really be fixed, only worked around) <br>
                - Exchanged the saving system in Stewie's Tweaks for CASM MCM (common bug with the tweaks that would cause loading saves to crash the game unless you started a new game and loaded the save from there, CASM doesn't have this problem)
                - Exchanged Realistic Wasteland Lighting for Nevada Skies (NS just got its last big update and is now a great mod) <br>
                - Removed Interior Fog Remover (incorporated into Stewie's Tweaks) <br>
                - Added Pre-generated LOD to the visuals module for if you followed the texture setup 1:1 <br>
                - Removed enabling of Fallout 3 Repair (made early game repair frustrating rather than difficult yet rewarding) <br>
                - Updated YGT (now includes Faction Armor Redone and Loot All Vehicles, along with a few others) <br>
                - Added VNV Follower Tweaks to Gameplay - Mechanics (you will need to fire all your companions and re-hire them for the changes to take effect) <br>
                - Added Less Rewarding Exploring to Gameplay - Mechanics <br>
                - Updated all Conflict Resolutions

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added Bypass Minigames to Gameplay - Mechanics (was planning on using Immersive Minigames instead but it didnt work out, also included in the Gameplay - Merge)

                - Added Iron Sights Recoil Animations to Gameplay - Mechanics 
            </p>
        <br>

        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>10/20/19</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Removed the Realistic Wasteland Lighting optional files (new NVGE preset settings make nights bright enough as-is imo, and the overcast weather adds some much needed variety to RWL)

        <br>

            </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>10/13/19</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Exchanged NVIDIA Inspector/AMD Control Panel for RivaTuner Statistics Server for limiting FPS (easier instructions/setup since its the same for NVIDIA and AMD cards and should cause less input lag since its a CPU-level frame limiter) <br>
                - Updated the NVGE preset, so the Water INI tweaks are no longer needed, also added a note about enabling the AO if you want
            </p>

        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>10/01/19</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added instructions to hide the meshes/scol folder from LOD Additions and Improvements and Much Needed LOD, and the textres/scol folder from Much Needed LOD (mesh from LOD Additions and Improvments is broken, textures/meshes from Much Needed LOD are for electro city. if youve already ran FNVLODGen without issues, you dont need to re-run it)<br>
                - Moved BSA Decompressor and OGG Vorbis Librariers to Core - Tools to hopefully stop people complaining about missing meshes because they can't read (if youve already installed the guide you dont need to do any of the moving around that im doing, its just to make it easier for people to follow) <br>
                - Moved UIO and MCM to top of Core - QOL (since some mods in Core - QOL require the MCM, and theres a specific bug with FOV slider that happens if you dont have MCM installed) <br>
                - Exchanged Stimpak Hotkey and Hotkey Scroll Wheel for Just Weapon Hweel (dont know if it needs to be said but this is fine to change on an existing save) <br>
                - Added Fix for Legion Armors back into Core - Merge (can be put back in the merge now that the mod that was causing the FormID complications was removed back in the big update)

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Removed Character Creation Plus from the Gameplay - Merge (forgot that zMerge doesn't like handling voice data for a lot of people) <br>
                - Forgot to mention that I added Inventory Search to Core - HUD/UI back in the 9/24 update

                - Expanded upon enabling extra features from Stewie's Tweaks in the Gameplay module (Gameplay - Mechanics) <br>

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Okay, this is about to be a massive wall of text. This update is the biggest one yet for the guide. Inspired by a recent Fallout 4 playthrough I did with a minimal amount of mods, 
                I've decided to remove a lot of the mods that I felt didn't affect gameplay enough to be included. I won't go into too much detail since I've been talking about it for a while on Discord, but even through
                a bunch of mods are being removed, you should barely notice any affect on your actual gameplay if any. And also this update, despite the size, should be fine on an existing save. 
                As always I can't promise that's the case, but you should be fine. Okay, lets get started: <br> <br>
                <strong>From the Core module:</strong> <br>
                Changed NVSE install instructions to download the recently released version <br>
                Re-added OneTweak, in turn changed install instructions for NVGE
                Added sub-sections at the end of most sections containing mods/tools that should be avoided
                Added FNVEdit editing to WMIM to fix a few bugs <br>
                Removed Legion AI/Combat Bark Fix (most important changes are covered by Asterra's Many Fixes, the one's that aren't weren't worth keeping) <br>
                Removed Reinforced Leather Armor Female Mesh Fix (shouldnt need to explain myself on this one) <br>
                Removed Fixed War Room Table (see above) <br>
                Removed Cass Class Fix (tag skills don't affect her gameplay) <br>
                Caleb McCaffery NPC and Hat Bug Fixes (fixes already done by YUP, albeit in a less efficient way) <br>
                Removed Nightkin Scripts Corrected (see above) <br>
                Added FNVEdit editing to Rebreather Tweaked <br>
                Exchanged Vendors Containers Respawn Fix for Simpler Vendor Respawn Fix (my version is a lot simpler as you can tell by the name, requires less conflict resolution) <br>
                Removed SafeAutoSave (ESPless alternative now in Stewie's Tweaks) <br>
                Added Asterra's Many Fixes - Collision Meshes Patch <br>
                Updated Stewie Tweaks INI to reflect new version <br>
                Removed all of the individual c6 (nvse) mods and replaced them with his tweaks package <br>
                Eddie Hears an Explosion will be moved to Content - Improved Vanilla Quests or whatever its called <br>
                Barton Thorn Acts Normally removed (the fact that he will follow you to the ends of the earth was more annoying than immersive) <br>
                Removed Clean Character Creation (some people just dont play on hardcore, also revised character thing might be usefull for like one person) <br>
                Removed First Aid NVSE (giving already OP companions chems is not a good idea) <br>
                Removed Muzzle Flash Control (not noticable) <br>
                Lonesome Road Roughin It Bedroll Kit Fix <br> (original implementation never bothered me, perfect example of me adding a mod because it exists rather than it actually being necessary) <br>
                Removed Day Tripper and Chemist Survivalist Style Fix (mostly fixed by YUP, albeit in a less efficient way. Also some changes are more gameplay oriented than QOL) <br>
                I think I moved Johnson Nash NCR Ammo Fix to Content - Improved Vanilla Quests if I even kept it idk oops <br>
                Removed Bypass Minigames (oh yeah was gonna replace this with something and forgot probably should get on that) <br>
                Exchanged individual Just mods with JustModsMered <br>
                Removed Project FNVIcons and all its related patches (no one ever checks the challenges tab anyways lol, also made for some annoying CR down the line) <br>
                Added Vanilla HUD Remastered to the DarnUI HUD section (guess I forgot to add it to this section?) <br>
                Updated the Conflict Resolution/Load Order.txt/Merge instructions <br> <br>
                <strong>From the Visuals section:</strong> <br>
                Changed order of Poco/NMC/Mgs (based on a poll I did in the Discord) <br>
                Removed Textures Over Time Sandstone/Stone Walls (was fine with Poco's implementation of both) <br>
                Updated ToT Honest Hearts LOD Fix (resizes 4k rock texture now too) <br>
                Added PM's HD Legion Overhaul (heart eyes emoji) <br>
                Removed Wasteland Clothing HD (mostly shitty AI upscaling, not worth performance impact)
                Replaced The Gruntening with Bornagain Combat Armor (preference) <br>
                Removed Shifting Shadows and Metal Armor Metalized (the leather parts of the metal armor looked more like footballs than actual leather used for clothing which made it look out of place) <br>
                Removed NCR Civilian Clothing (more of a recolor rather than actual retexture tbh) <br>
                Removed Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia (not compatible with WMIM) <br>
                Removed Nail Gun Retexture (has anyone ever used this gun before?) <br>
                Added instructions for hiding textures in EXE to prevent the pixelated water bug thing <br>
                Replaced Improved Cyberdogs Textures with Its a Dog's World (preference) <br>
                Removed the following due to un-noticablility: High Resolution Bulletin Board and Primm Flyers, High Res Vanilla Posters and Graffiti, Tweaked Cash Register, Hectrol Tumbleweed High Res Retex, Higher-Resolution Westside Craftsman Window, High Resolution Bobby Pin Box, Retextured Playing Cards, Lucky Shades use Authority Glasses Model, Boone's Machete is a Broad Machete, Improved Rawhide Cowboy Hat Mesh, Adjusted Gambler Hats <br>
                Removed Sheriff Meyers (Sheriff Duster/Hat are unique in vanilla, didnt want to change that) <br>
                Removed Pip-Boys to the People due to CR complications, might return if a few things go my way <br>
                Removed Mr. Gutsy/Handy Animated Eyes (eyes keep blinking after death, very uncanny) <br>
                Removed Mother Lupa and Vicious Violetta (bad dogs) <br>
                Updated Character Expansion Instructions for the new update <br>
                Removed High Resolution Male Body Textures (4k textures, not noticeable even for hand textures since most armors have gloves) <br>
                Removed Distributed Necklaces/Chains (after discussion on the Discord, necklaces werent lore friendly enough, weird that they show up on every NPC) <br>
                Removed Better Posture (not everyone is perfect, okay?) <br>
                Removed Gun Follows Crosshairs in First Person <br>
                Removed the entire Menu Visuals section and implemented Better Pause Menu into Tex/Models <br>
                Updated Conflict Resolution/Load Order.txt/etc for new update <br> <br>
                <strong>From the Gameplay Module:</strong> <br>
                Updated Yukichigai Gameplay Tweaks to remove a lot of the included mods that were too small, plugin was an absolute mess so i built it from the ground up, no more issues and a lot less patches are needed) <br>
                Removed VATS Alternative (JustModsMerged now has bullet time) <br>
                Removed the entire Gameplay - Combat/AI section, integrated BLEED and Melee Cleave into Gameplay - Mechanics (only the AI mods were actually removed, the AI mods were useless and honestly just made combat less fun) <br>
                Removed Cannibal Reborn <br>
                Removed Lonesome Road Flare Ammo (very niche item so it doesnt matter to me) <br>
                Will move Birds of a Feather Bear Arms Together to Content - Vanilla Quests Improved <br>
                Updated all the finish line shit i think you get the drill by now <br> <br>
                Okay that's it! (probably missed some stuff in the changelog, im only human). Come to the discord and yell at me for removing your favorite mod! <br>
                On a serious note, I've been working on this update for a while after going on a hiatus for a bit. This will be the last major update to the guide like this, should only be adding mods here and there as they release/get updated/etc. Thanks for all the continued support, I hope you guys understand the basis of these changes.

                - Removed Fix for the Legion Armors and Survivalist Style Fix from the Core - Merge for the time being (complications with how zMerge handles assigning FormIDs and how that affects conflict resolution. This should only be a temporary solution) <br>
                - Removed Collision Meshes - Ojo Bueno Patch from Visuals - Textures/Models (Poco Bueno has different meshes than Ojo Bueno and would need a different patch)

                - Removed Unnecessary Physics from Core - QOL (like the title of the mod says, its unnecessary and only a fun gimmick for the first minute of two of playing with it)

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Re-did the FNVLODGen settings (pretty much just used default terrain LOD settings for the best option and simplicity's sake)

                - Removed Legion AI Fix from the Core - Merge (didnt want to deal with people having the voice assets error, plugin space is completely fine anyways) <br>
                - Added instructions for hiding the .esp from Fallout 4 Styled BoS Uniforms in all Visuals - Textures/Models sections (should've been hidden because of the .esp replacer, I just forgot) <br>
                - Added instructions for hiding the .esp from the main file of Olly's Thematic Loadscreen Pack (.esp is replaced by the optional file, main file needs to be hidden so it doesnt show up after you merge the .esp from the optional file) <br>

                - Removed Improved Quest Objectives from Core - QOL and updated the Core/Gameplay Conflict Resolution FOMODs to reflect that (edits quest scripts/stages, makes for a lot of incompatibility. only included initially because i was going to include a mod that removed a lot of quest markers but it wouldve taken years to do the conflict resolution)
