                        None of the lists that follow are aimed at discrediting the work of certain authors nor direct any hate towards them. The goal is to provide alternatives to mods/tools that have been superseded, and to warn against problematic or placebo ones.

                    <h3>Gaining Independence</h3>
                    <p>
                        Modding past what the guide might include can feel intimidating at first. The purpose of this page is to give you a jump start in that process by highlighting mods and tools you should avoid, along with recommended additions that require minimal work to integrate into most lists (including DBF).
                        <br><br>
                        As you install more mods, make sure to get comfortable with the following principles:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Read descriptions carefully and check requirements.</li>
                        <li>Do not go overboard with the amount of mods all at once. Doing so is a common recipe for early annoyance that might sour the whole experience going forward, <strong>take it slow</strong> while you learn!</li>
                        <li>If a mod claims performance improvements, benchmark it.</li>
                        <li>When installing mods with a plugin, use <a href="https://moddinglinked.com/xedit.html" target="_blank">FNVEdit</a> and <a href="https://moddinglinked.com/themethod.html" target="_blank">The Method</a> to check for conflicts between it and the rest of your list.</li>
                        <li>If something breaks, troubleshoot using a <b>binary search</b>: disable mods in groups to isolate the problematic section, then narrow it down by splitting that group into smaller parts.</li>
                        <li>Join modding related communities! Lots of information can be found in conversations that already took place.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><br>

                    All of this is meant to help you build the skills and confidence needed to manage and expand your setup independently.

                    <h3>Bugfix & Optimization Mods</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>ENBoost</strong> - ENBoost works around the game's managed memory pool with memory sharing across processes. NVTF changes pool type and fixes the problem at the root, allowing higher VRAM usage. ENBoost also requires configuration based on the user's system and much like ENB, has been abandoned.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>New Vegas Stutter Remover</strong> - Will cause periodic crashes and there is no reason to use it anymore, even on Windows 7. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66537" target="_blank">New Vegas Tick Fix</a> replaces NVSR while also doing more. For more information on how to improve game performance, consult the <a href="https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html" target="_blank">Performance Guide</a>.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Zan AutoPurge Crash Protector, PCB Hotkey, and Clear Cache Hotkey</strong> - Purging cell buffers is already done by the game during fast travel. Adding these mods will increase the usage of this command for no real benefit, possibly causing stutter.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>FOOK, New Vegas Enhanced Content and Mission Mojave Ultimate Edition</strong> - Massively outdated compared to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664" target="_blank">Yukichigai Unofficial Patch</a> and will introduce bugs of their own.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>NVAC</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li>It mostly consists of very generic null checks that allow the program to run even when it should not be able to.</li>
                                <li>It can lead to increased instability and save corruption because of the unpredictable behavior after ignoring an error.</li>
                                <li>Crash logging is impossible with NVAC, meaning you will get nonsensical and useless crash logs.</li>
                                <li>NVAC's aggressive inlining and patching can conflict with other NVSE plugins. Due to the closed source nature of NVAC, not every conflict point is known, thus there's always a chance for NVAC to actually cause crashes due to memory corruption.</li>
                                <li>Most engine issues have been fixed in other plugins, meaning that the only use case NVAC has in the modern day is to hide issues of "normal" mods (scripts, meshes etc.).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Auto Clean All Fallout New Vegas DLC Ultimate Edition</strong> - Running QAC is a minuscule fraction of the changes needed to fix the DLCs. It will not do anything by itself. Use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/92289" target="_blank">Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes Remastered</a> instead.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Visual Mods</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Oversized textures</strong> - Based on the object size and how the texture is wrapped around it, you should pick textures with a reasonable resolution and avoid the very big ones also based on your display resolution. Keep in mind that the textures will not be displayed with their full resolution at all times, in fact they will be scaled down because of <a href="https://imgsli.com/MTMwNjU2" target="" _blank>mipmaps</a> based on distance and other factors, as shown with these sliders. Just for reference, a maximum of 2K at 1080p is a pretty safe bet in terms of balance.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>AI-upscaled texture packs</strong> - Mods upscaled with AI or other automated techniques generally are not worth the higher VRAM usage.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>ENB</strong> - Fallout 3 and New Vegas ENBs were never fully developed and have been abandoned by the author. This means they are left with some issues, like transparent and glowing objects (which can be somewhat mitigated with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73431" target="_blank">ENB Glowing Objects Overhaul</a>).
                            <br><br>
                            Due to its post-process and deferred nature, ENBs require MSAA to be disabled which introduces visual issues with alpha textures, that are not solvable with post-process anti-aliasing solutions.
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally, ENB's integration with the game is pretty high level and detection based, which means that mods modifying graphical features in-engine can easily break ENB by changing something as simple as a resolution of a rendered texture, or replacing a shader.
                            <br><br>
                            Many popular ENB features like LUTs, lens flares or god rays can be replicated with <a href="https://reshade.me/" target="_blank">ReShade</a>.
                            There's also <a href="https://discord.com/invite/QgN6mR6eTK" target="_blank">New Vegas Reloaded</a>, which while still in development, offers similar feature set, while adding graphical features such as PBR or real global shadows.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Fallout Character Overhaul</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Multiple broken file paths which cause missing mesh triangles and pink textures.</li>
                                <li>The installer auto-selects patches for mods you don't have installed.</li>
                                <li>It doesn't cover every NPC in the game.</li>
                                <li>The ghoul file and the <b>bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles</b> INI setting both reduce performance.</li>
                                <li>Reverts many YUP fixes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/87763" target="_blank">Simple Character Expansions</a> instead.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Handheld Pip-Boys, such as the 2500</strong> - All hand-held Pip-Boys share the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3NBafn5" target="_blank">same common visual bugs</a> that occur if you enter/exit your Pip-Boy too fast. The methods these mods use to hide the Pip-Boy in third person are also quite janky, as they were made before NVSE extensions like JIP LN. These bugs and quirks have mostly been removed with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/76009" target="_blank">Handheld Fixes</a> though. Either <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/49732" target="_blank">2500a</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65980" target="_blank">2000 Mk VI</a> are recommended.
                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <strong>Freeside & Strip Open</strong> - Same performance issue as Populated Casinos.

                            <strong>Nexus Mod Manager and Mod Organizer 1</strong> - No reason to use them over Mod Organizer 2.

                        <li>
                            <strong>LOOT</strong> - LOOT doesn't really have any idea about your mods and their inner structure - it just orders them based on tags in a masterlist managed by volunteers, meaning that it's impossible to account for every single mod and combination of them.
                            <br>
                            The main issue regarding LOOT in most Bethesda games is that its masterlists are often outdated or incomplete, leading to broken load orders that will cause mods to misbehave. Oblivion is an exception where LOOT tends to work more reliably.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Crash log readers</strong> - Crash logs require a plethora of knowledge to read, and in a lot of cases, the ability to confirm findings by reverse engineering the game's code. Automated solutions work through assumptions and by turning this further into a game of guessing. If the crash log contains enough named information (not always the case), a tool of this kind can turn useful as a way to narrow down possible causes, but at that point it just becomes a way to sort lines by frequency.
                            <br><br>
                            As large language models (AI) become more common, it might be tempting to use one to demystify a crash. In practice, though, their scarce knowledge of modding and engine-specific behavior often leads to incorrect conclusions, making them a big source of misinformation.
                            <br><br>
                            What then? Well, ideally, you never want to end up dealing with a crash log that offers no clear direction to begin with. The best prevention is to vet the mods you install and stay informed about any known issues. But if you do find yourself needing to interpret a crash, take the time to understand the game systems it references; that alone can often give an idea of the type of mod responsible.
                            <br><br>
                            If all else fails, many modding communities include people experienced in reverse engineering and, by extension, skilled at reading crash logs. Reaching out to them is often the most reliable way to get an accurate diagnosis. Keep in mind that crash logs are a tool; they merely take a snapshot of what happened <u>during</u> the crash, not why. Keep expectations in check, as in some cases they might not help to find a solution.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Bashed Patches</strong> - These patches have their use cases and in skilled hands can save a tremendous amount of time. It's not that they should be completely avoided period.
                            <br>
                            However, as it is often the case, automation without careful supervision can lead to errors. For this reason, it's only recommended to use them if you are both capable and willing to comb over the resulting patch.
                            <br>
                            LOOT and Bash tags are unused by majority of the SSE modding community, leading to complete breakage of the automated behavior of these mods.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Mator Smash</strong> - Outdated and produces broken patches. The only viable method of automated patching (keeping in mind what was said above) available is through a properly utilized Bashed Patch thanks to its sophisticated tagging system, which allows the user to customize how the generated patch handles individual records.
