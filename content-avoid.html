        <p class="moddesc">You may be wondering why some mods aren't in the guide, or are looking to add your own mods. If so, please reference this list:</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>WMX/WME:</strong> Incompatible with WMIM, and even if they did work they still need a lot of balance work</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>More Perks:</strong> Countless broken perks, bugs, spelling/grammar errors, and more</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>CAGE - Continue After Games Ending:</strong> Old and broken, replaced by FPGE</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>NV Interiors:</strong> Causes save bloat due to the large amount of havok-enabled items per interior</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Classic Fallout Weapons:</strong> Has many broken weapon meshes and breaks some leveled lists</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Primm Reputation Restored:</strong> Does not function properly, also impossible to get idolized because of oversights</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Simply Uncut:</strong> Most of the stuff isn't cut content, but rather fan-made versions of concept art. Also lacks quality in many places</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>New Vegas Landscape Overhaul Remastered:</strong> Will cause crashes due to broken navmeshes</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Outside Bets:</strong> Has some poor implementation of features that will result in bugs, also requires a good bit of conflict resolution. Useable if you can put up with that</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>A World of Pain:</strong> Awful balance for the entire mod, un-lore friendly locations, no voice acted NPCs, no room bounds/portals in interiors which can cause FPS loss. Also useable if that doesn't bother you</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Monster Mod:</strong> Bad meshes for many creatures which can cause crashing, terrible balance</p>
