            <p class="moddesc"> - <strong>Project Nevada</strong>: Outdated, inefficient, bloated, and some parts are plain broken. Most features have modern alternatives (see the list below),
                                It has almost 20 scripts that run every frame (!), will cause save bloat due to continuous quest stages running, and some features such as weapon charging and the AI changes do not work and/or break things.

                    <p class="moddesc"> - Although it may seem counterproductive to install a bunch of small mods to replace one big mod, all these alternatives are more modern, efficient, and 100% safe to use (and actually work), unlike Project Nevada</p>

                        </ul>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Solid Project:</strong> Poor scripting across the entire mod (such as there being a multi-frame delay every time you press the sprint key), has a major cause of quantity over quality, and its best features have been replaced by the "Just" series of mods</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>FOOK/NVEC:</strong> Massive compilations like these eventually fall behind and include old/broken versions of mods (for example, NVEC includes a version of the Burning Campfires that causes save bloat, and an outdated and laggy version of EVE), and overwrite many important mods like YUP</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Unlimited Companions (or pretty much any companion altering mod):</strong> Unlimited Companions recompiles all scripts in the game, and is also done by <a class="modsublink" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/50468" target="_blank">JIP CCC</a> (as are most companion related features, so check if JIP CCC covers it before installing any individual companion mods)</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Populated Casinos:</strong> Poorly made mod with many dirty edits/ITMs/UDRs, also the engine was just not designed for that many NPCs in the first place</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Freeside/Strip Open:</strong> Suffers from the same engine limitations as above, Freeside Open is also very buggy and requires a lot of patching (specifically with many quest mods)</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>True Wasteland Economy:</strong> Too many inefficient scripts running at the same time, will quickly cause save bloat</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Any AI mods:</strong> AI mods generally just edit a few gamesettings and don't change much or just make combat more of a nuisance (also Enhanced NPC Awareness is broken and XFO was made on a older unpatched version of FNV)</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Live Dismemberment:</strong> Happens way too often (had it happen to Sunny Smiles and Cheyenne 3 out of 5 times on the tutorial mission alone), and when NPCs are crawling, they often crawl through buildings/rocks/etc</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>Increased Wasteland Spawns:</strong> Causes save bloat due to using the PlaceAtMe function, Mojave Desert/Raiders safely add more enemies to the game</p>
            <p class="moddesc"><strong>DUST:</strong> Poorly made mod (almost 1000 errors in xEdit, a combo of deleted records, leftover null references, missing records, and more) and also incompatible with most mods</p>
